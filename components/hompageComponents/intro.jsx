        Hey there! I'm Jesus Oyervides Jr., a frontend web developer and a proud graduate of the University of Austin's Full Stack Development Bootcamp. Passionate about crafting user-friendly experiences, I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities for growth. When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking, enjoying strategic board games, or exploring new ventures. I'm also a voracious reader, delving into books across various topics to constantly expand my horizons. In addition to my development work, I volunteer for nonprofits, helping them revamp their website designs. I also run a book club, fostering a love for reading and discussions. Using Next.js, I've developed this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to navigate my website to learn more about me. Don't hesitate to reach out if you like what you see!
